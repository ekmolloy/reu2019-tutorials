IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 891 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences cardinalis_cardinalis_ku25393 and cardinalis_cardinalis_ku21828 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 column that contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file uce_phylip/uce-5806.nexus.phylip.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 1 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
