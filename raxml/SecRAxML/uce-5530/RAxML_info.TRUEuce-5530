IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences cardinalis_cardinalis_ku25393 and cardinalis_cardinalis_ku21828 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 4 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file uce_phylip/uce-5530.nexus.phylip.reduced
