IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 12 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 13 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences piranga_flava_ku90809 and piranga_lutea_ku89864 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences cardinalis_cardinalis_ku25393 and cardinalis_cardinalis_ku21828 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences piranga_bidentata_itm160 and piranga_bidentata_itm141 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file uce_phylip/uce-4395.nexus.phylip.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 2 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

 BFGS required too many iterations, reverting to Brent-based optimizer


WARNING the alpha parameter with a value of 12.065620 estimated by RAxML for partition number 0 with the name "No Name Provided"
is larger than 10.000000. You should do a model test and confirm that you actually need to incorporate a model of rate heterogeneity!
You can run inferences with a plain substitution model (without rate heterogeneity) by specifyng the CAT model and the "-V" option!
