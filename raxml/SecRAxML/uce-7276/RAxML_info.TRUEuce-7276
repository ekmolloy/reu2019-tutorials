IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences piranga_flava_ku90809 and piranga_lutea_ku89864 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences piranga_hepatica_ku4970 and piranga_bidentata_itm160 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences piranga_rubra_sdsu2654 and piranga_rubra_sdsu2635 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 4 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file uce_phylip/uce-7276.nexus.phylip.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 2 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
