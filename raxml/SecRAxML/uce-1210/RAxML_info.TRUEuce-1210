IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences piranga_rubra_ku26592 and piranga_rubra_sdsu2654 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences piranga_flava_ku90809 and piranga_hepatica_ku4970 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file uce_phylip/uce-1210.nexus.phylip.reduced
