IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences crossoptilon_crossoptilon and lophophorus_impejanus are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences crossoptilon_crossoptilon and lophura_swinhoii are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences crossoptilon_crossoptilon and perdix_dauuricae are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file ../input_data/aligns/tackle_data/uce-5951.fasta.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"

 BFGS required too many iterations, reverting to Brent-based optimizer


WARNING the alpha parameter with a value of 12.924880 estimated by RAxML for partition number 0 with the name "No Name Provided"
is larger than 10.000000. You should do a model test and confirm that you actually need to incorporate a model of rate heterogeneity!
You can run inferences with a plain substitution model (without rate heterogeneity) by specifyng the CAT model and the "-V" option!
